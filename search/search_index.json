The pattern used allows for seamless horizontal scaling to minimize the latency between the time the transaction is committed to the transactional database and when it is available to be queried in the reporting database.</p> <p>The architecture of the solution you will build is shown below:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>The portfolio microservice sits at the center of the application. This microservice:</p> <ul> <li>sends completed transactions to an IBM MQ queue.</li> <li>calls the trade-history service to get aggregated historical trade data.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The Kafka Connect source uses the Kafka Connect framework and an IBM MQ source to consume the transaction data from IBM MQ and sends it to a topic in IBM Event Streams. By scaling this service horizontally you can decrease the latency between the time the transaction is committed to the transactional database and when it is available to be queried in the reporting database,</p> </li> <li> <p>The Kafka Connect sink uses the Kafka Connect framework and a Mongodb sink to receive the transaction data from IBM Event Streams  and publishes it to the reporting database.
